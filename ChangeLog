version 1.4

version 1.5
	* changed %L to %ll because Apple sucks. Many thanks to JC for finding out 

version 1.6
	* fixed junk being displayed after the ascii value 

version 1.7
	Changes from Ian Kumlien:
		* Reworked the main code part to handle dynamic length numbers, 
			it will now only display the "bytes" used.
		* Some code cleanups and reworking.
		* Switched to using 64bit datatypes due to enhanced restrictions
			with the compiler flags.
		* Now indicates nibbles with + and bytes with ^
		* Now displays the octal value as well if someone wants to know.
		* Removed -Werror since -ansi causes a warning on Mac OS X
			since they define PRIu64 using a q qualifier that is
			not ansi.
		* Added MSVC C99 compability from JC
